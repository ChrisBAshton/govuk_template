The GOV.UK Design System launched on 22 June 2018
===============

GOV.UK Template is:

- no longer maintained
- will only be updated for major bug fixes and security patches
- does not meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 level AA) accessibility standard](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)

This framework will remain available in case youâ€™re currently using it. To help your service meet accessibility requirements, you should use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). You can [migrate to the Design System from GOV.UK Template](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/migrating-from-legacy-products/).

# GOV.UK Template

This provides a template containing the GOV.UK header and footer, and associated assets. It provides a consistent GOV.UK brand experience across `www.gov.uk` and all services running under the `service.gov.uk` domain.

The template is built from [`source`](source/) files, and multiple packages are generated to support different languages and frameworks.

Packages are available for [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/govuk_template), NPM ([mustache](https://npmjs.org/package/govuk_template_mustache), [ejs](https://npmjs.org/package/govuk_template_ejs),  [jinja](https://npmjs.org/package/govuk_template_jinja)), and other [templating languages](docs/packaging.md).


## Previewing the template
